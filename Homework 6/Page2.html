        <h1>A story you say, hmmm?</h1>
        <br>
        One day not very long ago...
        In a wee little place called Missoulee<br>
        A sillee little plan<br>
        By a boy who roamed about the land<br>
        Was hatched thinking no harm could be done<br>
        The boy from the trees planned to play with the bees<br> 
        Of course, no harm could be done.<br>
